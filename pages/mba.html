                    <p>This event helps discover the marketer in you. Participants either in teams or as individuals are given some used/ refurbished/ recyclable products using which they can create an entirely different product thereby tapping the potential in the innovators. These final products have to be sold to students, teachers or anyone within the university campus. The winners of the event will be decided based upon the extent of creativity imparted in the making of the product, quality of the marketing strategy used, the number of items sold and finally, the amount of money that each team made. Marketing Mayhem will definitely test whether you are ingenious enough to overcome the various impediments that marketers and innovators brook around the globe</p>
