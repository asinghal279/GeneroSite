                            <p>Roller coasters are thrill rides that operates like a railroad track. The history of this ride reflects a constant search for greater and more death-defying thrills. They are made from steel or wood and comprise a series of hills and drops, sudden turns, track loops and corkscrew-like elements. Roller coasters don’t have engines, they must be pulled by the gravity to the top of the first big hill. As the roller coaster rises higher, its potential energy increases and reaches maximum at crest of hill. The potential energy accumulated by the rise in height is transferred to kinetic energy as the cars race down the first downward slope. Teams shall design and build a “roller coaster” meeting the requirements of below rules. The “roller coaster” shall mean the entire structure, including the roller coaster track and the base, but not the actual vehicle. The “COASTER” shall mean the vehicle that travels on the Roller Coaster track.</p>

                            <p>Imagination is not only to devise which has no existence, but to perceive what really exists. Imagination is not an art, but the method of learning. Beat-d-Euclid, as the name suggests is an event which encourages the students to outdo Euclid in geometry with their powers of imagination. This is an on-the-spot event which tests the perception and modelling abilities of participants. It is the 2D visualisation of a given 3D structure using AutoCAD software.</p>

                            <p>A truss is a structure that consists of members organised into connected triangles so that the overall assembly behaves as a single object. Trusses are most commonly used in bridges, roofs and towers. A truss is made up of a web of triangles joined together to enable the even distribution of weight and the handling of changing tension and compression without bending or shearing. The triangle is geometrically stable when compared to a four (or more) -sided shape which requires that the corner joints are fixed to prevent shearing.</p>
