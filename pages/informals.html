After some time, the music stops and the referee orders the newspaper to be folded in half (teams may step on the floor during that time). Then, the music (and dancing) starts again. The team that manages to "survive" the dancing as last pair has of course won the game.</p>

                            <p>Treasure hunts come in a large variety of types with different sets of rules. Some treasure hunts are a race to find the final clue and solve it. For others, each clue is worth points and sometimes offers the choice of completing one of two tasks. Basically there are three rounds in this event. During each round the winning contestants will be taken forward to the next level. Two rounds consist of finding and interpreting the clues which would be given to participants by the event coordinators. Difficulty level will increases with every round. We will provide appropriate number of clues if the participants fail to achieve the given task.</p>
