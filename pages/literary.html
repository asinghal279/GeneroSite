                            Each delegate/delegation attending the conference has been assigned one or more countries, and each country is represented by at least two delegates in different committees. During the conference, each committee will have official sessions, lunch-breaks and delegate meetings, where delegations will meet several times a day. In most committees, the session time is divided between formal debate, caucuses, and the resolution writing process.</em></p>

                            <p>Each committee will be chaired by a president and his or her assistants. The president is normally called the “chair”, while the assistants are 2 called “rapporteurs”. They are responsible for conducting the session and voting procedures of the committee and will ensure that all delegates act according to the RoP. Together they are called the “dais” and normally decide how the rules are interpreted, applied and who is recognised to speak.  Although this sounds as if the chair has ultimate authority in regard of the rules, it is possible to challenge these decisions. Whereas the chairs at MUN GENERO’19 are experienced at UN models and at interpreting rules, they are not infallible. If a delegate thinks that the dais has made a mistake, they should rise for ‘a point of order’ or even appeal the decision of the chair.<br> Contrary to the rules of the real UN, the chair at MUN GENERO’19 will not be elected from or by the committee. In the UN as well as the NMUN, all delegates are prepared to fulfil the role of the chair and therefore have extensive knowledge of the rules and their interpretation. At MUN GENERO’19, the members of the dais will be provided by the organising team.<br><em> Note: These rules can be changed with time depending on the applications received within the committees of the conference for a position in the dias.</em></p>

                            <p>At MUN GENERO’19, information for each other or the dais is passed by a short note/chit,  since the rule of decorum forbids talking during speeches. The note is sent through the committee and note paper may be the only exception to the national symbol rule as it allows the delegates to know which delegation has sent a note. Note passing is not permitted during a speech and normally occurs between speeches.<br>Depending on the committee, the chair may appoint pagers. Pagers are people who collect notes, read and deliver them to other delegates or the dais. The chair will ask the delegates if anyone is willing to be a pager for a certain amount of time, i.e. a couple of hours. Note passing is only possible during normal session. Any form of note passing is strictly prohibited during the voting procedure.<br><em>Note: Pagers can be appointed beforehand depending on the rules and the final decision of the selection body. Volunteers need not be members as such.</em></p>
